# Maze-Self-Exploring-Bot-With-Reinforcement-Learning
This is my topic in my final year project. Although I finished my degree study, I still continue to work on this project because I believe there is a room for the improvement so that in future I can further improve the bot performance. Conference paper is attached, you can have a look if you are interested.
